Core Dumps
----------

If Zrythm crashed, then the log file may not contain enough
information to help us fix the issue. In this case, please
generate a core dump file and send it to us.

Generating Core Dumps on GNU/Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need to type some commands into a terminal. Also,
please make sure you have ``systemd-coredump`` or the equivalent
package installed on your distro.

.. note:: The following steps apply to systemd users (the vast
   majority of GNU/Linux users). For non-systemd users, you can
   usually obtain the core file in the current directory after
   running the first 2 commands below and running Zrythm until
   it crashes.

First, enable core dumps:

.. code-block:: bash

  ulimit -c unlimited

Tell Linux to add the PID (Process ID) to the core dump:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo sysctl -w kernel.core_uses_pid=1

Run Zrythm and make it crash. An intermediate core dump file
should now be generated in :file:`/var/lib/systemd/coredump`.
Use ``coredumpctl`` to verify:

.. code-block:: bash

  coredumpctl list -1

You should see something like the following:

.. code-block:: text

  TIME                          PID  UID  GID SIG    COREFILE EXE
  Thu 2023-08-24 05:48:14 CDT 23179 1000 1000 SIGILL present  /opt/zrythm-1.0.0.beta.4.12.1/bin/zrythm

Note that under `COREFILE` it says `present`, so a core file
exists.

Now we can finally export the core dump file to a
location of our choice (in this case in my :file:`Downloads`
directory)  by passing the PID to ``coredumpctl``:

.. code-block:: bash

  coredumpctl dump 23179 --output=/home/alex/Downloads/core.23179

.. important:: Change the file path given to ``--output`` to
   your desired location.

Please send us the core dump file (in the example above it can
be found at :file:`/home/alex/Downloads/core.23179`).
