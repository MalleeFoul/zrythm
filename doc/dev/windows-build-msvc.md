# Building on Windows (MSVC)

> you install VisualStudio community edition, python, git (those 3 are just click click installers) then open "Developer powershell for VS2019" (you should have that in windows apps after installing vs), pip install meson, git clone `your_project`, meson build, ninja -C build
> what are you supposed to do about dependencies btw? what's the general practice?
> Port them all to meson and build them as subproject

> chocolatey also has packages for all those things: https://gitlab.gnome.org/creiter/gitlab-ci-win32-runner-v2/-/blob/master/ansible/setup.yml#L57
> nice! does meson in the vs command prompt see the chocolatey packages by default?
> If you have a pkgconfig from chocolatey, yes.

1. Install as admin https://chocolatey.org/install
