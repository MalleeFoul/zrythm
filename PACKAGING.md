# Included Programs

For various reasons, Zrythm ships with some libraries/resources
that could be packaged separately. If you wish to package them
separately and make Zrythm use them, you can pass the flags
found in `meson_options.txt`.

# Debug Symbols

Please do not strip symbols to assist with meaningful stack
traces which are sent with bug reports.

# Docs

See the `manpage` and `user_manual` meson options.

# Post-Install Commands

Depending on the distro, some of the following commands will
need to be run with appropriate options. Some distros run these
automatically.

    glib-compile-schemas
    fc-cache
    gtk-update-icon-cache
    update-mime-database
    update-desktop-database
    update-gdk-pixbuf-loaders

See the
[post-install script](scripts/meson-post-install.sh)
for more details.

# Trademarks
As mentioned in the
[Trademark Policy](TRADEMARKS.md),
if you wish to distribute modified versions of Zrythm, you
must either get permission or replace the name and logo.

To replace the trademarked name and logo, you can use the
`program_name` and `custom_logo_and_splash` meson options,
after replacing all files inside
`data/icon-themes/zrythm-dark/scalable/apps`. There may be more
things that need to be changed that we missed. If you find any,
please let us know.
